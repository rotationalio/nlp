These are citations for sources used for research for the `quant` package.

## SLP 3rd edition

"SLP" is an NLP textbook that was used to source many of the algorithms for the `quant` package.

## NLTK Book

The NLTK Book is a book about using NLTK, an NLP library for Python, to analyze text that was used for various information for the `quant` package.

## Porter stemming algorithm

The Porter stemmer is English stemming algorithm that's fairly simple to implement (below is the 'official' homepage).

* Martin Porter. The Porter Stemming Algorithm. Online edition, 2006. The Porter Stemming Algorithm, <https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/index.html>.

This source presents a "case study" for how to implement the Porter stemmer in the Snowball language.
This article is simple to understand and adapt to other languages.

## Porter2/Snowball stemming algorithm

A stemming algorithm that supports several languages and is a slight improvement on the Porter stemming algorithm for English, with some differences in the resulting stems.
The English version of the algorithm called Porter2 is linked in the reference below.

* Martin Porter. The English (Porter2) stemming algorithm. Online edition, 2002. The English (Porter2) stemming algorithm, <http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/english/stemmer.html>.

This source is an article on "developing the English stemmer" for how to implement the Porter2 stemmer in the Snowball language.
This article is simple to understand and adapt to other languages.
